I have a Ph.D. in physics and work as staff scientist in the (Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine [INM-2](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-2)) of the [Research Center JÃ¼lich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en), Germany. I am a passionate learner and enjoy always to learn from interdisciplinary work. 

My major research interest is the development and performance evaluation of **advanced neuroimaging and machine learning methods** to study **sleep, circadian variation and neurodegeneration**. 

Sleep and circadian rhythms are fundamental in biological organisms, and growing evidence indicates that they are associated with several major neurodegenerative disorders. Functional and structural neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to study the effect of sleep on the brain as well as to image biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence and machine learning with open-science multi-omics data can be used to study the relationship between environmental factors, genetics, and neurodegenerative diseases. These **highly interdisciplinary** approches often require **methodology which goes beyond the state of the art**.

I am always happy to welcome motivated people. Just contact me via si.beer@fz-juelich.de.
