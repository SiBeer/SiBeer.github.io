Sleep and circadian rhythms are fundamental in biological organisms, and growing evidence indicates that they are associated with several major neurodegenerative disorders. Functional and structural neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows to study the effect of sleep on the brain as well as to image biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Artificial intelligence and machine learning with open-science multi-omics data can be used to study the relationship between environmental factors and genetics, and neurodegenerative diseases. These highly interdisciplinary approches often require methodology which goes beyond the state of the art.

My major research interest is the development and performance evaluation of advanced neuroimaging and machine learning methods to study the link between sleep, circadian variation, and neurodegeneration. The main research topics are:

* The use of explainable AI to extract new information from multi-omics data
* Phantom development for hybrid MRI/PET
* PET imaging in awake animals (SleepLess Project)
* Quantitative PET

I teach PET technique, radiation protection and mathematics within the Module "Experimental and Translational Neuroimaging" of the Master Programme Translational Neuroscience at Heinrich-Heine-University (HHU) DÃ¼sseldorf.
