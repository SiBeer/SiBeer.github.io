## Phantom development for hybrid MRI/PET


### About the project
Phantom measurements for PET/MRI hybrid imaging technology, which combines MRI soft tissue morphological imaging with PET functional imaging, are of strong interest for improving, tuning and analyzing the performance of the scanners and as a ground truth for method development and evaluation in attenuation and motion correction, image reconstruction and general image quality assessment. However, creating multimodal phantoms for use in simultaneous acquisition of PET and MRI remains challenging. The image contrast in PET is caused by radiotracer distribution, and in MRI by proton relaxation times. The materials used in one modality might produce strong artifacts in images from the other modality, or might even be completely invisible.

### Methodological aspects
We examine materials, compositions and construction options using 3D printing, to build a PET phantom with tissue equivalent properties for MRI. We operate a KISS200 3D printer with dual extruder, optimized for printing experimental materials. 

### Funding
This project was funded in part by the [Palestinian-German Science Bridge](https://www.palast.ps/en/what-we-do/science-bridges/pgsb).
